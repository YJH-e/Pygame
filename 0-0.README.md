BUGS

for Mansion of the Day (all of 2-2)
- no changing between day and night (after sun and moon arcs across )

for space invader bullet
- i tried using x_pos for player, but x_pos is none on the corners and first touches edges, but can change both when only player is moving across and vertically

for sprite: I tried using the collide function in this way:
flakeNum = 0
        for flakeNum in range (0, len(x_co)):
            #checks if new snowflake is adjacent or overlapping a previous snowflake
            while pygame.sprite.spritecollide(my_snow, my_snow, True) == True:
                self.rect.x = random.randrange(0, x_size-5) 
                self.rect.y = random.randrange(0, y_size-5)
            #endwhile
        #next
in the (class) Snow to see if it checks for adjacent or overlapping snowsflakes, but said 'Snow' object has no attribute to 'sprite'



notes:



HOLY GRAIL space invaders
- no global attributes other than Done = False
- all initial variables added self. in front in Game class
- no passing of variables into functions in Game and Scoreboard class in game loop
