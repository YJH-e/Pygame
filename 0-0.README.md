BUGS

for Mansion of the Day (all of 2-2)
- no changing between day and night (after sun and moon arcs across )


for sprite (all)
- no recreating snowflake in case of overlapping and being adjacent using the group
  (one possible but memory inefficient method would be using a 2D list to store all flake locations)


for space invaders (all)
- why is player a sprite? can player be an individual rectangle like the paddle in pong?
